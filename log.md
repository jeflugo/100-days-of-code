# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 20, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Made a simple registration form with basic functionality

**Thoughts:** It was a refreshner for me, i think about doing the challenge all about react so i figured better start with something simple, also i got a litle confused with the input change handler, i didnt quite remembered how that worked.
