# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 20, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Made a simple registration form with basic functionality

**Thoughts:** It was a refreshner for me, i think about doing the challenge all about react so i figured better start with something simple, also i got a litle confused with the input change handler, i didnt quite remembered how that worked.

### Day 2: April 21, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Still a simple challenge, a responsive navbar.

**Thoughts:** Recalled a lot of things about tailwind and how to setup a vite enviroment with react, also was able to use my favorite icon package "react icons" so that was nice.

### Day 3: April 22, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Todo list app with local storage functionality.

**Thoughts:** feeling more comfortable using react again and todos i used localstorage again in a long time its good to save your data somewhere.
