# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 20, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Made a simple registration form with basic functionality

**Thoughts:** It was a refreshner for me, i think about doing the challenge all about react so i figured better start with something simple, also i got a litle confused with the input change handler, i didnt quite remembered how that worked.

### Day 2: April 21, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Still a simple challenge, a responsive navbar.

**Thoughts:** Recalled a lot of things about tailwind and how to setup a vite enviroment with react, also was able to use my favorite icon package "react icons" so that was nice.

### Day 3: April 22, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Todo list app with local storage functionality.

**Thoughts:** feeling more comfortable using react again and todos i used localstorage again in a long time its good to save your data somewhere.

### Day 4: April 23, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Accordion with animations.

**Thoughts:** im not gonna lie i really struggled with this one, but only in the animation part i just couldnt get it right but its done now, its not perfect animation but i did it.

### Day 5: April 24, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Sortable list with ordering state functionality.

**Thoughts:** Today was more aout understanding than coding i copied a lot of todays code from the DnD kit docs, anfter that i spent some time playing with the code and watching how this library acctually works, i learned a lot.

### Day 6: April 25, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Pagination component.

**Thoughts:** not much to tell, got i litle stressed out today, i couldnt find the right way to do the component or at least thats what i thought but it was just me blocking myself from something that was actually very simple just needed to read a litle to get it right.

### Day 7: April 26, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Carousel component.

**Thoughts:** Today was about buildeing a simple carousel i felt overwhelmed when i first tought about doing it but once you start its very simple, i didnt do anything fancy of course. Alsoi took my time to lear how to setup vite with react from scratch today.
